    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "Here, we provide a workflow to run a mechanistic model of the NPZD-type (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton-Detritus), using near in-situ data to quantify the relative contributions of the bottom-up and top-down drivers in phytoplankton dynamics. NPZD models are commonly used and describe four ecosystem components, nutrients, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detritus. This NPZD model with fixed elemental ratios is adjusted from the NPZD model of Soetaert and Herman (2009), Otero et al. (2023), and Schartau et al. (2007). The model resolves parts of the carbon and nitrogen cycle.\n",
    "In this model, phytoplankton dynamics are simulated based on information from nutrient concentrations and zooplankton density. Based on these simulations using in-situ data, it is possible to calculate and visualize the relative contribution of each bottom-up or top-down driver, i.e. (1) nutrients, (2) Sea Surface Temperature (SST), (3) photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and (4) zooplankton grazing, over time (Figure 1).\n",
    "Carbon dynamics are simulated based on the marine biological carbon pump (Figure 1). The carbon pump in marine ecosystems operates as a key mechanism for carbon dynamics. During photosynthesis, the phytoplankton captures carbon from the atmosphere, converting it into organic matter in the pelagic food web. This carbon is then transported downward as plankton and other organic material die and sink, forming detritus. As the detritus descends through the water column, it undergoes decomposition and remineralization, releasing carbon back into the water as Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC). This process not only regulates the distribution of carbon in the ocean but also plays a critical role in the global carbon cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Marine phytoplankton is at the base of the marine food web and regulates functions in coastal ecosystems. Changes observed in the marine plankton community are expected to have a knock-on effect throughout the food web. Therefore, understanding how primary production changes through time and space is of key importance to better quantify the effects of human activities and their impact on the ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the methodology presented in this document, it is possible to analyze which factors drive the phytoplankton dynamics and how these factors change in space and time. Additionally, it is possible to simulate the carbon dynamics in the detritus compartment, i.e. carbon sequestration. This workflow initially focused on the Belgian part of the North Sea (BPNS), located in the southern part of the North Sea, where high density of observations are available. Now, it is extended to the Northern Adriatic region improving reproducibility of the workflow. For other regions, this document can be used as a guideline to perform similar analyses. It is important to note that the principles behind the modeling approach are universally applicable. When applying the model to another area recalibration of the model to the local conditions is required for optimal performance (cfr. section 3.1 and 3.2).\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by describing the input data, R scripts, and functions that were used for this Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton (NPZD) model. Then, this manual will guide you step by step on how to run the NPZD model. At the end, phyto- and zooplankton dynamics will be simulated, and the relative contributions of the environmental parameters estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Modeling Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The ecosystem model for Nutrient, Phytoplankton, Zooplankton, and Detritus was used to simulate changes in plankton density (Soetaert and Herman, 2009). This model describes daily changes in phyto- and zooplankton density based on abiotic parameters (Fig. 1).The variables in the model are expressed in mmol N m<sup>-3</sup> and mmol C m<sup>-3</sup>. Daily changes in these variables are expressed in  mmol N m<sup>-3</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> and mmol C m<sup>-3</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is useful to describe marine and freshwater systems. The state variables are nutrients, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detritus. The workflow focused on a marine system and followed a similar methodology as described in Everaert et al. (2015). Nutrients are defined as the total density of Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN), Phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub>) and Silicate (SiO<sub>4</sub>). DIN is defined as the sum of NH<sub>4</sub>, NO<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*Figure 1*. The top figure illustrates the NPZD model in the ecosystem. The figure below shows the structure of the NPZD ecological model, with the state variables and main processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Input Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The model requires the following input data: \n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in °C\n",
    "  2. Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) in PSU\n",
    "  3. Nutrients (DIN, PO<sub>4</sub>, SiO<sub>4</sub>) in mmol N m<sup>-3</sup> (or P or Si equivalent)\n",
    "  4. Carbon data (pCO<sub>2 atmosphere</sub>, windspeed, pH)\n",
    "  5. Threshold values for each parameter per region\n",
    "\n",
    "For calibration and validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Chlorophyll-a (µg Chl m<sup>-3</sup>)\n",
    "  2. Zooplankton abundances (ind m<sup>3-</sup>)\n",
    "  3. partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (pCO<sub>2 seawater</sub>; µatm)\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3. Study Area\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow is focused on the Belgian part of the North Sea (BPNS; Fig. 2), located in the southern part of the North Sea, and the Gulf of Trieste, located in the northern Adriatic Sea. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the BPNS, the following locations are the selected sampling stations used in the analyses presented in this document. We focused on nearshore, midshore, and offshore regions. We analysed one nearshore station (code 130 in the LifeWatch campaigns), one midshore (code 330) and seven offshore stations. The offshore stations were grouped to have a sufficient amount of data as the offshore region was sampled seasonally, whereas the other regions were sampled monthly.\n",

    "\n",
    "For the Gulf of Trieste, the data was collected from the C1 station. This station lies in the nearshore region and is also used in the analyses presented in this document.\n",
