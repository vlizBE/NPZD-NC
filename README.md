# Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton-Detritus model (Nitrogen and Carbon units)

This model is developed under **Blue-Cloud2026 VLab 3: Carbon-Plankton Dynamics**, simulating the dynamics of carbon and plankton in marine ecosystems using a mechanistic Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton-Detritus (**NPZD**) model.

## Overview
The **Blue-Cloud2026 VLab 3 Carbon-Plankton Dynamic** project models interactions between nutrients, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detritus in marine environments. The NPZD model captures essential ecological processes, providing insights into carbon cycling and plankton population dynamics.

## Features
- Mechanistic NPZD model with customizable parameters.
- Simulates carbon flow through different trophic levels.
- Outputs include nutrient concentrations, plankton biomass, and detritus levels over time.
- Configurable for different marine ecosystems and scenarios.

## Installation

Via Blue-Cloud2026 Vlab - ?????

## Usage

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook to start the simulation:**
   NAME NOTEBOOK

2. **Modify parameters in `config.json` to simulate different scenarios.**

3. **View output data and plots in the `output/` directory.**

Example configuration (`config.json`):
```json
{
  "initial_nutrient_concentration": 10.0,
  "phytoplankton_growth_rate": 1.2,
  "zooplankton_grazing_rate": 0.8,
  "detritus_decay_rate": 0.1,
  "simulation_duration": 365
}
```

## Model Details
The NPZD model simulates four key compartments:

1. **Nutrients (N):** Essential elements required for phytoplankton growth.
2. **Phytoplankton (P):** Primary producers converting nutrients into biomass through photosynthesis.
3. **Zooplankton (Z):** Consumers feeding on phytoplankton.
4. **Detritus (D):** Non-living organic material resulting from dead organisms and waste products.

Key processes:
- Nutrient uptake by phytoplankton.
- Grazing of phytoplankton by zooplankton.
- Mortality and decomposition contributing to detritus.
- Recycling of detritus into nutrients.
